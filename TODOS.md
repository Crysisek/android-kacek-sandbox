# What's this all about
This file contains all major [TODO] comments. When encountered a situation for which the [TODO] here already exists, just type

`// TODO-x` (where `x` is a [TODO] number)

above the problematic code.

# TODOS
## TODO-1 
When [Enable K2 Kotlin mode] option in Android Studio will be more stable
then we will be able to use the following syntax:

`
 val value: StateFlow<Type>
     field = MutableStateFlow(initial)
`
